discontinued the game engine because the code was poorly structured and I felt it wasn't worth continuing, I'm going to do it again from scratch studying a lot more
my new game engine: https://crashyengine.vercel.app
note: this new game engine will be private, so no one will use it except me. I will use it for my projects.
