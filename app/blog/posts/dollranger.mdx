## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.11 or higher
- Vulkan SDK
- GLFW
- GCC or MinGW (for Windows)
- Git
- glm

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dollengo/DollRanger

```

2. **Setup the engine:**

```bash
./unixSetup.sh
```
or execute `mingwSetup.bat` on Windows.

3. **Build the project:**

```bash
./unixBuild.sh
```
