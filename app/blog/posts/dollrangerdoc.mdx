summary: 'Im making a website for the DollRanger documentation.'

I realized that DollRanger was a bit confusing for beginners, even for me, lol. Anyway, so I realized that it would be good to make documentation for it. I just finished the main code categories. I left out the libraries like: Flecs, SDL, because they are kind of an optional extension for those who are already specialized in them and want to use DollRanger. I made all the code documentation in MarkDown (.md). And now I started developing the site using Docusaurus, I already had an experience with Docusaurus on the first DollengoStudios site, it was amazing, but it is not the style of the site. So I decided to change to this style because it is really cool to write these blog posts. Anyway, stay tuned because it will soon be released in dollranger.vercel.app
