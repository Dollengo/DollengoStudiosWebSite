# VoxelData Overview

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Dollengo/VoxelData)

VoxelData is a software application designed for storing and managing data using voxel-based storage techniques. It allows users to organize data into partitions, chunks, and voxels, making it suitable for various object storage applications.

## Features

- **Partition Management:** Create and manage partitions (directories) to organize your data.
- **Chunk Organization:** Group data into chunks, where each chunk represents a set of voxels.
- **Voxel Storage:** Store individual pieces of data within voxels, which can be organized hierarchically.
- **Data Accessibility:** Easily access and manipulate stored data through structured partition, chunk, and voxel management.
